# RicFinity To-Do List Applet

## 1. Description

### 1.1 What does it do?

This is a great console-based to-do list I made. You can record tasks you want yourself to complete. As well, you can set the importance and due date for every task. Moreover, the applet provides modify and deletion for users.

### 1.2 Technologies I used

Coding Language: **C++**

- I used this language because this is the primary language for myself. Also, this language is pretty fast and works well with console-based programs.

Development platform I used: **Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022**

- This is a great IDE. The code editor is my favorite, and I have been using it since I first encounter computer science.

Source Control: **Git & GitHub**

- These tools make me manage my project very well. They give me chances to "regret" and modify my errors.

### 1.3 Challenges I faced

When checking the date validity of the users' inputs, I used string manipulations for my approaches. But that method caused many errors, so then after almost a day, I changed my algorithm to checking using math and that method was significantly better.

### 1.4 Features I hope to add in future

- I hope to add databases or files to store the data so that the tasks will remain there even if the applet is closed
- I want to let the tasks have subtasks, which are the steps to complete a single task
- I want to add collaboration functions so that users can keep their data on the cloud drive and they can share the tasks. This is especially good for a hackathon, a science project, and so on.
- Add reminder functions. This could be done by using libraries to hold the dates and times calculations.

## 2. How to run the applet

The easiest way to do so is by downloading the application file via the following path: HawkHacks Project TODO List/x64/Debug/HawkHacks Project TODO List.exe

Then, run the application on the computer, and enjoy!

## 3. How to use the applet

- Open the application, and you can see a control menu. You have to accomplish each operation by entering the appropriate number
- You need to create at least one task to make any other operations possible
  - when creating a task, be careful with the data entry or you will not be able to create one
- A normal task has a bullet sign while an important task (starred task) has a star sign
- If you don't like a task, you can modify it; and if you think it's totally useless, you can delete it
- Every time you complete your task, you can mark it as done. Then, the task's status sign will change from cross to checkmark.
- The tasks inside the program are sorted from most important and most urgent to least important to least urgent.
- You can filter out all the starred tasks or all the tasks with due dates.
