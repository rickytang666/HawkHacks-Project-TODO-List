## Description

### What does it do?
This application allows users to record tasks they want to complete. Users can set the importance and due date for every task. The application also provides options for modifying and deleting tasks.

### Technologies Used
- **Coding Language**: C++
- **Development Platform**: Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022
- **Source Control**: Git & GitHub

### Challenges Faced
One of the main challenges was validating the date inputs from users. Initially, string manipulations were used, but this approach caused many errors. The algorithm was later changed to use mathematical checks, which proved to be significantly better.

### Future Improvements
- Add databases or files to store the data so that the tasks will remain there even if the application is closed.
- Allow tasks to have subtasks.
- Add collaboration functions for sharing tasks.
- Add reminder functions using libraries to handle date and time calculations.

## Installation
The easiest way to run the application is by downloading the executable file via the following path: HawkHacks Project TODO List/x64/Debug/HawkHacks Project TODO List.exe

## Usage
Open the application to see a control menu. Each operation can be accomplished by entering the appropriate number. You need to create at least one task to make any other operations possible. When creating a task, be careful with the data entry or you will not be able to create one.
